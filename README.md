# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This is a simple **Tic-Tac-Toe** game implemented in ReactJS. The game can be played between two players.
It's a great way to demonstrate basic game logic, UI/UX design, and turn-based gameplay mechanics.

## Features

- Playable by two players
- Clean and intuitive user interface
- Displays game status (e.g., "Player X's turn", "Player O wins")
- Refresh the page to start a new game

## Game Rules

1. The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
2. Player 1 is **X** and Player 2 is **O**. Players take turns placing their marks in empty cells.
3. The first player to get 3 of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.
4. If all 9 cells are filled and no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a draw.
